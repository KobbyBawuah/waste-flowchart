# Problem Statement

The app was aimed at helping my colleagues categorize different types of waste and managing those categorizations. It provides a user-friendly interface with buttons, icons, and the ability to edit the underlying data. The data is stored in JSON format and can be saved, reset, and edited using the provided components and interactions.
